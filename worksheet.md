## Lab 5.0 Worksheet

Name(s) and Login(s):



1. Identify three functions you've used prior to this lab and 
identify the return type, the function identifier (name) and
its parameter types.  

For example, the math library's `pow` function has the following
characteristics:
  * Return Type: `double`
  * Function Name: `pow`
  * Parameter Type(s): `(double, double)`
  

2. Open all the files and review the code to answer the following 
questions.

  a) Identify all of the user-defined functions in the program 
  along with the functions' return types and the number of parameters 
  they accept.
  
  
  b) Among the functions `main`, `strToIntArray`, `insertionSort`, 
  and `getOrderStatistic`: identify which function calls which 
  other function(s).
  
  
  c) How might you implement the following function?  Hint: it 
  should only be a one-liner.
  ```c
  int getMin(int *arr, n) {

  }
  ```

  d) Prototypes and documentation were placed in the header file 
  and function definitions were placed into a separate source file.
  Identify at least one advantage of this approach.

3. Demonstrate your final color utility program and testing 
file to a lab instructor, have them sign this worksheet and 
turn it in.
